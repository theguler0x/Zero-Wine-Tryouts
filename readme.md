Zero Wine Tryouts: A Malware Analysis Tool

Introduction:
Zero wine is an open source (GPL v2) research project to dynamically analyze the behavior of malware. Zero wine just runs the malware using WINE in a safe virtual sandbox (in an isolated environment) collecting information about the APIs called by the program.

The output generated by wine (using the debug environment variable WINEDEBUG) are the API calls used by the malware (and the values used by it, of course). With this information, analyzing malware's behavior turns out to be very easy.


This is Zero Wine Tryouts Alpha 5 Prebuilt VMware Image. (.vmdk)
